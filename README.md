# Problem Statement: Hard to track COVID contact tracing. 

## Solution: COVID PATH => An application that tracks all the registered users to keep you informed about your vicinity.

### Assumptions:
    > We have a good amount of traffic
    > We have valid information about users, whether they have COVID or not
    
    
### Features:
    > Notifying users when they crossed path with a COVID suspected person(or COVID confirmed person)
    > Giving a notification to any person that has interacted with another user that has gotten COVID in the last 15 days(still working on this)
